		<h2>Task 1: Review Professional Writing Characteristics</h2>
	</div>
<p>In this section of the task we were to review and study characteristics of texts that are successful. In reading this, I understood that for text to be successful it must, among other things, reach a level of understandability. Whether this comes from its readability, its accessibility, or how engaging it is; text has a responsibility to answer the question of the page user. So too, the information displayed via text must come of use, rather than a waste of time. With issues such as skimming on online formats of text, the display of it is crucial to its usefulness.</p> 
<p> In task two, I will evaluate how successfully a certain website employs professional writing characteristics, and analyse how it achieves this, but also, how it could improve.</p>

	<h3>Task 1: Review Professional Writing Characteristics</h3>
	</div>	
<p>I have decided to evaluate the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/secondary/">BBC Bitesize</a> web page. In 2020 this web page had around 519k users each week as a tool to learn from home. So too, I have chosen this website as it is aimed for users of a similar age and background as who I intend to aim my webpage to. Additionally, this website is used for educational purposes, similarly to mines. As a tool used widely in the UK by students and teachers, I think it will be interesting to see critically evaluate how they display their information.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>PROFESSIONAL WRITING CHARACTERISTICS</th>
    <th>WEBSITE EVALUATION</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Accuracy</td>
    <td>The content provided on this web page is highly accurate. As a public corporation, responsible to provide educational content to the nation. All the content is certified, and there are hyperlinks throughout, directing you to other web pages either backing up previous content, or directing you to further studies. For example, on the higher history section of the website, at the bottom there are links to <a href="https://education.gov.scot">Education Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.history.co.uk">History.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/#google_vignette">History Learning site</a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Active Voice</td>
    <td>The website does not necessarily use personal language, rather it is quite direct, and to the point. There is nothing implying it was written by one voice, however, I would argue it uses a successful active voice through its thorough, impersonal formatting. It feels impersonal, but not in an uninviting way, rather, it brings a sense of formality, key to an educational space. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Limit Bias</td>
    <td>From what I have read there are no biases on this page. It allows education to all levels, and all subjects. The only bias I am able to grasp is the limited educational content available in some subjects compared to others. This means that some pupils will not be able to access and gain as much content as other users of the same web page. This may be a consequence of trying to accommodate to too many audiences at once. However, the website also includes information in Gaelic and Welsh, which is a very inclusive attribute as not many other educational websites aimed for British children may be available in a language other than English. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Clarity</td>
    <td>Some things may seem unclear, however, this is because there are so many different options depending on what course a certain user is taking. Because of this, certain information may not seem clear from the get-go, however, once you read a bit, everything is explained, and all the information is explained in an accessible manner. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Conciseness</td>
    <td>This page is set out into a lot of sub-sections. This is successful in diminishing wordiness. It allows for users to navigate the page to exactly that is beneficial for them, avoiding an over stimulus of irrelevant information. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Conversation/ Smooth Prose</td>
    <td>Firstly, correct contractions are used throughout. The language is very simple and readable. Each piece of information is sectioned to a fitting sub-heading, and dispersed between multiple short, spaced out sentences. This results in a simple, easily comprehendible web page. Also its use of other multimedia's (videos and images) between chunks of text retain the reader's attention. Also, they allow for different types of learners to attain knowledge. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Correctness</td>
    <td>Unsurprisingly, I did not notice any errors in grammar or spelling. The organisation was concise and effective. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Parallelism</td>
    <td>The writing technique used on this web page does not use much parallelism. I think it is formatted in a way that helps a subject individually, crafted in a way that is effective in educating for each. So too, there is different content in each page, and different variations of information to be taught. It is a bit more informative in some higher ranked levels (Highers, A levels etc.), and more descriptive in its information. However, lower levels sparingly use the simplicity of parallelisms. This shows the adaptability and diversity of this web page, attempting to suit it to each level of user. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Positive Voice</td>
    <td>Particularly in the careers and assessment section of the web page, there is a positive, encouraging tone used. The language used gives hope to users and approaches more difficult, daunting subjects in an optimistic tone. This is important for young users in reinforcing encouragement and determination.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Strong Nouns and Verbs</td>
    <td>Again, the writing format of this website is very concise and easy to interpret. Sentences are made short and informative. So too, not much reading is required to gain knowledge or know how to reach the information you may be using the page for.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Sentence Variety</td>
    <td>One sentence leads smoothly to the next. Little repetition is done, with each sentence a new point is made.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Simple words</td>
    <td>The language used is clearly aimed at the level in which the user has selected. This website is successful in sectioning out different ability levels also, so someone studying one subject at one level may not understand the language used for another subject at another level. This is not because of the websites inaccessible language, but rather because each page is manufactured for a certain level of pre-existing knowledge. In saying that, the website is useful in hyperlinking you to another page to explain a concept that maybe more complex and in need of revisiting. Overall it is very successful in its use of language, and makes for a very understandable educational tool.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Shorter Paragraphs</td>
    <td>In analysing multiple pages from this website, it averages three sentences per paragraph. These are successful in still conveying the information needed to be conveyed, as well as maintaining the users attention.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Tone and Voice</td>
    <td>As a government website, this webpage adopts a formal tone. As previously mentioned, there is no personal tone in this. It is solely available as a tool for education. In reading and using the page there is no feeling of bias through language. It feels completely impersonal, which in some cases may be a fault of the page, but for its intentions it is an effective mode of conveying information. Some of the educational videos and games available give more of a charismatic approach to learning which makes up for the dense, blunt language throughout.</td>
  </tr>

	<h3>Task 3: The AWE Writing Process</h3>
	</div>		
	
<p>Mizrahi states that the first step of writing is to assess (2012). This is the process of defining your audience and defining the purpose of your text. At this stage of my project, I am fully certain of my audience. My web page will be used and accessed by kids aged roughly 12-17, with additional use potentially coming from teachers, using it as a tool to help with education. As for purpose, informing, persuading, requesting, and entertaining are the four intentions of text according to Mizrahi (2012). In terms of my web page, I intend to both inform and entertain, pulling benefits from both as a means of my users retaining information. My main intention is to inform, however, in appealing to younger audiences, I think entertaining is equally as important, otherwise their attention will be lost. To think of sources where young people get information nowadays; Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, they get quick inputs of information. So too, minimal use of blocks of text and more use of multimedia in place may be a more effective tool in delivering content. I am still in need to conduct more research on what actual information is going to be displayed on my website, then I will be able to begin categorising and organising a layout/ format for how my page will flow. </p>
<p>The second step in Mizrahi's writing process is to write. This involves creating a draft and reading and revising (2013). As for writing content for my actual web page, I have not yet begun. However, I believe that is more of a task for next semester. This semester I am more focused on how to optimize my users' experience. For now, I aim to understand how they are going to learn and enjoy the use of my website, rather than actually what they are going to learn. Though, of course, that will come with further, in depth, research on my topic.</p>
<p>The third, and final step is to edit (Mizrahi, 2013). I have done this throughout my project proposal. I have gone back and evaluated what texts are effective, where I am maybe using a tone that is not suited, or a passive voice rather that active. In considering the professional writing characteristics (Mizrahi, 2013), I have learned to write in a more professional manner. I understand the importance of how my text is displayed in order to optimize reception.</p>
