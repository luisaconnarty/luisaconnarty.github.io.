		<h2>Task 1: Identify Key Narrative Points and Make a Plan</h2>
	</div>
	<p>The resources I used to help plan my narrative design were <a href="https://elementor.com/blog/storytelling-in-web-design/">How to use storytelling in design</a> and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/elements-storytelling/">Elements of storytelling</a>.</p>
	
	
	<p>From these resources I gathered these as the main points to consider when thinking of my narrative structure for my website:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>My storytelling does not necessarily need to be linear</li>
			<li>Having a character throughout my website may increase engagement in the story</li>
			<li>It is crucial for the story of the website to be clear (set an objective), this could be proposed in the opening page...?</li>
			<li>Many elements go into storytelling e.g. form, shape, line, colour</li>
			<li>A good story "explains, engages, and can enlighten an audience" (National Geographic)</li>
			<li>Other sensory elements can enhance learning and storytelling (e.g. audio, video, image, infographic)</li>

<!----- BEGINNING OF TASK 2 -------->

	<section id="task2">
	<div id="taskheader">
		<h2>Task 2: Incorporate your Narrative into your Portfolio</h2>
	</div>

	<p>A good story "explains, engages, and can enlighten the audience" (National geographic). In considering this, I took into account a study by Large, Beheshti, Nesset and Bowler (2007). This group conducted research on certain design outlines for creating a web page for young person's use.</p>
	<p> In directing my website to younger audiences, I though these guidelines would come as a useful, and accurate guidance. So too, I have decided for my websites narrative, to adopt a thematical narrative. This is because, in their research, it was concluded that the employment of thematical design or metaphorical design were the most successful (2007).</p>
	
		<div id="opening">
		
	<img src="images/homepage.jpg" alt="homepage" height="400">	
	
		</div>
		
	<p>The image above is a rough mood board for envisioning the opening page of my webpage to envision. I will take the user on a journey of creating a safe online identity, and learn how to safely navigate and optimize online communities.</p>
	<p>Once the start button is pressed I will include different sections such as "setting up an online identity", "risks of online community", "benefits of online community" and "finding a safe space online". These different sections will allow for an educational guide to conclude the narrative in the application and knowledge of not only safe, but also awareness when browsing online.</p>
	<p>The main character of this narrative will be the user, this is to enhance engagement. So too, I will use an array of sensory experiences. As an example of a sensory element to the narrative is I intend to create other online profiles.</p>
	<p>Using similar tools to my character templates in <a href="week_2_il.html">week 2's IL activity</a>, I can combine audio and visual learning to enhance accessibility and reach out to all different kinds of learners.</p>
