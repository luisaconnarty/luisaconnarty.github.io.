		<h2>Task 1: Optimise Your Audio for Web use</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>This activity involved cropping and optimising the audio files</p>
	<p>In editing my audio clips, other than cropping the sounds in order to reduce the file size. I also altered the volume as to not exceed the sampling rate which would be needed with my expected audio.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, I layered together multiple sound files in order to create my character narratives, involving the mediation of sound, making sure one did not override the other in an ineffective way.</p>
	
	<p>I then exported my files in .MP3 format. This is because this file format, with WAV or OGG being preferred quality standard, is supported on every browser.</p>
