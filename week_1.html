		<h1>WEEK 1 INDEPENDENT LEARNING TASK</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: choosing your topic</h2>
		<p>My initial ideas for a choice of topic were as follows:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>why should we safely organise our data?</li>
				<li>digitisation (explore deeper)</li>
				<li>why we should be wary of misinformation</li>
				<li>AI: why is it positive/ negative?</li>
				<li>Why is community online is important/integral?</li>
			    <li>Risks of digital community and identity</li>
			
		</ul>
		
	
		<p><b>NARROWED DOWN TOPICS</b></P>
		
		<P>DIGITISATION</P>
		<li>Who would benefit? Educational sector such as school/ universities, as well as GLAMS</li>	
		<li>how would they benefit? Would be easy to access information remotely/ anywhere at all times. This digitised information can then be used for further research etc.</li>
		
		<p>AI</P>
		<li>Who would benefit? With a very widespread concern surrounding the topic of AI many could benefit from a website as a tool for education</li>
		<li>How would they benefit? Bring about an ease of mind, as well as an understanding and accountability</li>
		
		<p>DIGITAL COMMUNITY/ IDENTITY</P>
		<li>Who would benefit? Both younger and older generations. Those new and also those who are familiar with media. Anyone with online presence in essence</li>
		<li>how would they benefit? Raise awareness of online community and what it really means/ why it is important/ important to be safe</li>

		<h2>Task 2: Explore the scope of the topic and narrow down the focus</h2>
		
		
		<p> upon reflection my idea website idea is... </p>
		
		<br></br>
		
		<p><b>"How does your online community effect you?"</b></p>
		
		<br></br>
		
		<p> In the next few weeks I intend to narrow down the topic for my website, but to begin, I will use this as guidance and a starting point for my research </p>

		<p><b>Part 1 + 2: Booleans and Logging Search Terms</b></P>
		
		<p>To begin my research I used tools such as the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/">Glasgow Uni library</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to find resources.</p>
		
		<p>My keyword searches included:</P>
			<li>"online" "communit*"</li>
			<li>"online comunit*" and "online identity"</li>
			<li>"social media" and "identity" or "presence" or "community"</li>
			<li>"social media" and "dangers" and "identity"</li>
			<li>"benefits" and "online community"</li>
			<li>"twitter" and "online identity"</li>
			
		<p>My intention with these searches was to find academic resources which answered the questions of <b>what does "online community" mean, subjectively and objectively? What are examples of online identity? What are the impacts of online identity/ social media presence?</b></P>
		  
		<br></br>
		
		<p><b>Part 3: Reflection </b></P>
		
		<p>I found the use of the truncation help vastly further my search to a much broader extent. My first set of keywords was extremely useful in giving highly cited academic papers. However, it was a very broad search and so I quicky realised I needed to use more niche language to get information and literature in more specialised and catered areas. But, I did find that in these searches being so broad, I could use citations from broader papers to find information on subjects I could potentially use. Bearing this in mind, the concept of 'design thinking' is a repetitive process of trial and error. So too, throughout this research I will be interchanging methods and ideas to suit what I want to produce and how I want it to be perceived/ who is perceiving it.</P>
		
		<p>I found other searches I used were no help at all for the same reasons of being too broad, but with the information that came up, there was nothing that was helpful as a resource.</P>
		
		
		<p><b>Part 4: Depth Exploration </b></P>
		
		<p>Visualisation of different questions that could be asked surrounding a google search of "online communities" on the <a href="https://answerthepublic.com">AnswerThePublic</a> search engine.</p>

		<h2>Task 3: Keeping track of your resources</h2>
		<!-- INSERT THE HYPERLINK FOR GOOGLE SCHOLAR AND GU LIBRARY -->
		<p>To begin my research I used tools such as the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/">Glasgow Uni library</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to find scholarly articles which were informative on PIMS and to investigate misuse of data, and the effects on social media users. I will continue to log my resources on the <a href="mada-metadata_justification_table.xlsx">metadata and justification table excel spreadsheet </a> provided on the class Moodle. </p>
