		<h2>Task 1: Identifying Your Audience</h2>
		
	</div>
		<p>In consideration of my topic, I think the topic of my website could potentially be helpful to many people, as most people have an online presence. However, I have decided to appeal to a younger audience of pre-teens and teens.</p>
		<P>My reasoning for this is because these people will be newer to joining communities and creating online social identities. So too, informing them on what a social identity is and how to safely go about it will be extremely beneficial to them specifically (I believe).</P>

  <tr>
    <th>AUDIENCE</th>
    <th>RATIONALE</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AGE</td>
    <td>Writing for teens allows the opportunity to be a bit more mature in the way that I write. However, I must consider that they would not want dense language. To hold a teens attention is hard, thus, short, interactive methods of informing them would probably be preferred.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GENDER</td>
    <td>I am not appealing to any one gender in general. If anything, I would use as inclusive language as possible as to not disregard one's identity.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY</td>
    <td>I will be writing in English, however, I can acknowledge that this really limits the audiences my website will reach.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EDUCATION LEVEL</td>
    <td>My audience will be younger, but not children. Therefore I can use informative, elaborate language to an extent. However, I must keep language basic, and display information in a way that is clear, readable and easily understood.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>ATTITUDE TOWARDS WRITER</td>
    <td>I will write in a fashion to not scare, but warn and create a wariness to my audience. I do not want the website to cause the reader major concern, but to create a reaction that brings awareness to the topic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>KNOWLEDGE OF TOPIC</td>
    <td>I do not expect my website to be geared to experts of the topic. Rather, I imagine that my audience will have basic knowledge, this can be used as an educational tool to reinforce and expand upon what I imagine they will have been told by other seniors in their life previously.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AUDIENCE REACTION</td>
    <td>As aforementioned, I wish to an extent for my audience to be wary of their actions online and the way they present themselves. I hope that it would encourage readers/users to change their own presence to a more secure, as well as question and consider their digital footprint.</td>

		<h3>Task 2: BUILDING AUDIENCE PERSONA</h3>
		
	</div>	
	
	<p>I used the online source <a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva<a> to create theoretical audience personas. Discussing potential web habits/online presence, knowledge level of online identity/ community, and their goals in using this website:</P>

	<h4>Task 3: EXPLORING THE AUDIENCE'S NEEDS IN RELATION TO DESIGN</h4>

<p><b>User Stories</b></p>
<P>I began by using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories">UK Government</a> website to learn how to write user stories for my previously established personas. To build a user story you must include the actor, the narrative and the goal. The actor in this case being theoretical users of the website.</P>
<p>Here are some examples of my user stories, as adhering to the guidelines on the website:</p>
<br></br> 
<p>"As a school teacher, I want to access tools to aid and develop what I am teaching in my class, so that my pupils can have a broad knowledge on a concept I am not extensive on."</p>
<br></br> 
<p>"As a pre-teen without social media, I want to know how to safely use social media as a way of communicating, so that I can talk to my friends online in a safe and secure manner."</p>
<br></br> 
<p>"As an avid social media user, I want to know what to do if something were to go wrong in my online communities, so that I can continue using online communities as a safe-space comfortably."</p>
<br></br> 

<p><b>User Need Statements</b></p>
<p>I found that a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-need-statements/">user need statements</a> follow a similar path in this stage of design thinking. In this, you identify who may be a potential user, their need from this website is and their final goal they wish to achieve in accessing said website.</p>
<br></br> 

<p><b>The Laddering Technique</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/07/laddering-a-research-interview-technique-for-uncovering-core-values.php">The laddering technique</a> focuses on an A-C-V sequence. This "indicates the relationship between a product attribute and a core value" (Gibbons, 2019).</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTE:</p>
<P>Likely to be the first thing a user notices in the website, but they should not be the only focus in creating a product.</P>

<P>CONSEQUENCES:</P>
<P>Understanding the impact of certain attributes rather than solely their aesthetic.</P>

<P>VALUE:</P>
<P>The reasons people would use, recommend and return to a product.</P>

<P>I did not conduct an actual laddering interview, however, I grasped the importance of asking <i>why?</i> In response to most outcomes. Considering every aspect of the website and <i>why it is important? And who is it important to? And why is it important to them? And why is x formatting better than Y?</i> Etc.</P>
