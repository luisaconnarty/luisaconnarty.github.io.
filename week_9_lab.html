<p><b>VIDEO 1:</b></p>

<p>This is the version of my video that I would argue is the most optimised for web use.</p>

<p>Previous to this form of the video, there were individual clips which I trimmed, split, removed sound from, and placed in a narrative order.</p>

<p>Additionally, I added informative text at the end.</p>

<p>I then exported the file to its best quality of 4K and compressed it to the best quality made available.</p> 
<p> A problem I found with this was that the file then became too big to be processed, so too, I had to find other formats of compressing the file size</p>

<div id="vid2">

<p><b>VIDEO 2:</b></p>

<p>For this version of my video I cut majority of the content out and decided to add sound and motion effects.</p>

<p>I slowed down the clip of the girl's eyes, and added a siren sound effect when the fake news article appeared on screen.</p>

<p>The manipulation of motion and addition of sound can have emotive effects, and progress a narrative. However, they can also have negative effects, such as in this case.</p>

<p>The addition of the siren is overbearing, and distracts the viewer from the video. It also causes issues with accessibility, analysed more in <a href="week_10.html">week 10's</a> tasks.

	<video width='1000' height="600" controls>
	<source src="video/dmis_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	
<p>Additionally I exported this to 480p resolution. This is an extremely low quality, meaning the video can have a maximum of 60 frames per second.</p>

<p>This results in an extremely low quality video, not suitable for users used to high, 4k quality that is easily accessed today.</p>

<div id="vid3">

<p><b>VIDEO 3:</b></p>

<p>This version of the video is not any different to the first video, editing-wise.</p>

<p>However, I have, again, lowered the quality of the video.</p>

	<video width='1000' height="600" controls>
	<source src="video/dmis_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>


<p>Low quality videos often suffer from pixelation, reduced clarity and distorted colours. This can make it challenging to discern details of the video used.</p>

<p>It also effects the audio, so it impacts the ability to understand the narration and understanding of narrative.</p>

<p>Overall, the first use is the optimal as it allows for the best comprehension of this educational/ informative content, and will attain the most enjoyment regarding the user experience.</p>
