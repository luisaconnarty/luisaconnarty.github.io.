	<a href="http://www.dokimos.org/ajff/">CHOSEN WEBSITE 1:</a>
	</div>
	<p>To even summarise this website is extremely difficult as there is no clear theme or direction. The overall message/ information it is providing is in relation to a branch of Christianity called maverick Christians.</p>
	<p>One principle of design thinking is "discover" (British Design Council, 2005). This website makes the discovery of information near impossible. This is through over stimulating graphics, mismatched fonts with backgrounds and overcrowding of the web page. Disregarding the visual displeasure of this website, it also makes no sense technically. The page does not easily flow from one page onto the next. I also found it extremely difficult to do simple tasks such as retrace my steps and get back to the home page. Additionally, the page had tens of hyperlinks to what was meant to be different external content. However, each of these links sent you to the same page, indicating an error in the code. 
There was no pleasure in using this website, resulting in me giving up from even attempting to gain wisdom from it almost immediately.</p>
	<p>Overall, this website has ineffective, overcomplicated features, resulting in an inefficient, unusable website. From my use of it I experienced nothing of benefit, more so, displeasure and frustration. This is not what a creator should want out of a (so-called) informative webpage. This is a clear example of <b>bad web design</b>.</p>
		
<br></br>

	<div id="header">
	<a href="https://designmuseum.org">CHOSEN WEBSITE 2:</a>
	</div>
	<p>Upon first glance of the homepage of this website, the information of what it is for, is clear. It is clearly the website for the Design Museum, a museum located in London that displays and educates on contemporary design.</p>
	<p>In contrast to the last website, this web design is significantly slick and easy to navigate. The visuals are stimulating and appealing; easy on the eyes. They navigate the user naturally and intrigue you to read more, rather than supplying a dry overload of information, or oppositely, an overwhelming colour-fest of uncomplimentary colours and images. If I was set out to look for specific information such as opening times, locations, what exhibitions are on etc. I found it easy to navigate myself through the website to locate said information. When you click on a link there are no hidden surprises, you are directed to/ given exactly what was set out on paper. The addition of a search bar in the menu is also an advanced tool to further advance easy navigation.</p>
	<p>Overall, this is a clear example of <b>good web design</b>. It is simple and smooth. Information is found easily. And it is visually stimulating, whilst also fitting the theme of the website and museum.</p>

	<section id="task_2">

		<h2>Task 2: Consider Your Audience</h2>
	</div>
	
			
	<p><b>CRITERIA TO CONSIDER:</b></p>		
	
	<br></br>
	
	<P>THE AUDIENCE:</P>
	<p>The audience that are going to benefit content wise are teachers and pupils from secondary schooling level. 
		So too, I will have to include enough information to inform and develop these children with further knowledge. As well as this I will have to provide extensive knowledge so it is an efficient tool for teachers, as well as an aid to their potential work overload.</p>
	
	<p>AFFORDANCES</p>
	<p>The purpose is as an educational tool that can be used in schools. This means I will have to make the website content heavy, yet visually stimulating and potentially interactive. 
		It will have to be easy to navigate, so that its use is easy for younger people and can use visual stimulus as a learning tool to adapt to all different types of learners.</p>
	
	<p>VISUAL DESIGN</p>
	<p>This will all come later and fall into place as I begin constructing the website but research has gone into how to produce a successful and effective website for young people. For young audiences visuals must be engaging, creative and interactive. My webpage must keep the interest of its users. Colour coding different topics/ subjects within my web page may aid in memorising and learning, alongside with creating an orderly and well organised web page.</p>
	
	<p>CONTENT DESIGN</p>
	<p>Again, the content must be readable to a variety of age groups. This could involve maybe attaching a 'further knowledge' page with harder concepts and more mature settings. Yet, involving nothing that might seem too mature for the younger users as they will still have access to view it on the page.  
		The content must be relevant regarding the age group. And I can include sources to further their research and knowledge/ application.</p>
