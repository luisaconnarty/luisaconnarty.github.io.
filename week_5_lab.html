	<p><b><u>Part one</u></b></p>
	
	<p>This is my result when putting the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/secondary/">BBC Bitesize</a> URL into <a href="https://voyant-tools.org">VoyantTools</a>:

	<p>The visual diagram in the top left corner displays the most used word to be GCSE. This shows that the page is used as an educational tool, yet can be seen to accommodate more, or at least mention more of English based learning curriculum. There are a whopping 14 mentions of GCSE, and yet no data highlighting the words national 4/5 or higher. The Welsh and Irish learning levels are highlighted but remain in the shadows.</p>
	<p>The same diagram however gives good ideas as to what kinds of educational benefits the page has, and directions in which it aims. It conveys different subheadings that are covered, such as 'sport' and 'careers', as well as other formats of education, such as 'game'. </p> 
	<p>The bottom left diagram shows that there are on average 42.8 words per sentence. This is not many words. This shows the concise method conveying information on this web page. The readability index is 104.018. This is extremely impressive. An easily readable text must be at least 60 or higher. This means the website is highly comprehend. </p> 
	<p>The top middle visualisation helps understand how different words relate to one another and what topics are interconnected. It develops an understanding of contextualising a certain topics place on the web  
	I find the top and bottom right figures to be complex and unclear. However, this exercise has developed my thinking on visualisations and their effectiveness. In placing content into a visual form, the ability to interpret and learn information is developed widely. </p>

		<h2>Task 2: Create Samples of Text</h2>

<p><b><u>Sample 1</u></b></p>

<div id="sample1_text">

<p>With reference to the professional writing characteristics outlined in the <a href="week_5_il.html">week 5 independent learning activity</a>, I think this example of text has both positives and negatives. Visually, I think the text is clear, concise, simple and using short paragraphs. These are all traits of good information display. I have made the title clear so that the reader immediately knows what information will be found on the page. I have then made all the points bigger, so they are easily comprehended, and the added information the smallest, as it is the least essential part. Visual aids have also been placed in order to stimulate and educate the user. The sentences all vary, except the accuracy of the page is questionable as there is no evidence backing it up. However, my idea is to include the evidence on the following page, as to not overload this one visualisation. To enhance this page I could use parallelism to emphasise communication and potentially include hyperlinks to examples of when these things have happened from unsafe personal information management. </p>

<div id="sample2_text">

<p>Following a similar format to the last piece of text, this text gives an acronym to describe ways in which to be safe online. In using an acronym the text is concise and memorable. It successfully communicates the points that I aim to be taught, in an efficient manner. An acronym can be a useful tool in ensuring that a topic is memorised, and creates easy understanding. All the text is eye catching, none of it gets lost in the page, and the emphasis on the subheadings catches the users eyes. I once again have used shorter paragraphs and a more formal, clear and active tone in my writing. So too, the information is easily attained. Furthermore, the different uses of colour and multimedia create a fun, vibrant page that intrigues the user. Rather than a bleak, information-filled page, this piece of text is successful in answering questions the user may be approaching this web-page with, in an effective manner. </p>

<p><b><u>Sample 3</u></b></p>
<div id="sample3">

</div>

<div id="sample3_text">

<p>This is a sample of the homepage text. It clearly introduces the topic of my web page in a formal matter. In the tone used, this text creates a notion of importance and informative content. Readily setting a user up for what overall theme is going to be mentioned. In having the click button at the bottom, it gives an element of interaction, and has a real sense of beginning a journey. This is essential in creating a narrative, a tool in webpage format that we researched in week 3. The use of colour and bold text in this page grabs the users attention, as one would intend to do on a home page. So too, the user will be intrigued to keep using, rather than immediately leave the page in aims of finding another resource. The text used on a homepage is crucial, as users must be intrigued and satisfied from the beginning in order to remain on the page. In appealing to younger audiences, this introduction to my page is simple, endearing and intriguing, using multiple medias to maintain interaction and interest. </p>
