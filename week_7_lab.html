	<section class="task1">
	

	<p>For this activity we focused on editing our images on GIMP, in order to optimize the image quality on our web pages</p>
	
	
	<p>I edited several pictures to different standards, in order to compare their values</p>
	
	
	
	<div id="image_table">	
		<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>IMAGE</th>
    <th>RATING</th>
    <th>ANALYSIS
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="week7lab/smartonline-img-800px-72ppi-greyscale.jpg" alt="fakenews" height="150"></td>
    <td>Unusable</td>
    <td>This image is unusable as the information/ text displayed is unreadable. The image pixels and resolution are too high, making the information displayed incomprehensible. Furthermore, the greyscale added to the picture takes away the colourful appeal half of its image had in its purpose. Thus it would not be a beneficial addition to my webpage.  </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="week7lab/x-icon-img-300px-100ppi-greyscale.png" height="150"></td>
    <td>Excellent</td>
    <td>This image is as good as you could desire for multiple reasons. Firstly, the image is excellent quality. Being a PNG file, no matter how much I scale the image, its quality remains to the same high standard. Additionally, through cropping and compressing the image, rather than using 2.3MB it uses 506.2KB. This enormous decline in space will optimise web efficiency. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="week7lab/twitter-icon-img-455px-71ppi.jpg" alt="fakenews" height="150"></td>
    <td>Fine</td>
    <td>This image is beneficial in similar ways to the previous (consistently excellent quality). However, because for this image I did not compress the file size, it is still nearly 2MB in size. This means it will use more of the consumers data and and may cause issues with loading time. So too, for this image to be excellent I would need to compress the file size to optimise not only its visuals, but its use. </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="week7lab/fakenews-img-800px-72ppi-grescale-revert.jpg" alt="fakenews" height="150"></td>
    <td>Marginal</td>
    <td>This image is beneficial in terms of its quality. However, in cropping the picture, in order to reduce the file size, I have eliminated half of the image. So too, it is only showing half of what the actual image is.</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="week7lab/fakenews-img-800px-72ppi-greyscalestay.jpg" alt="fakenews" height="150"></td>
    <td>Fine</td>
    <td> This image has both positives and negatives. The quality is excellent, the resolutions are perfect, as is the scaling. One issue is the monocrhome greyscale, but that can be converted back to colour. THe importance of its previous colour is significant in its enjoyment. Additionally, I converted it to greyscale and then back to RGB significantly increasing the file size in doing so. Again, this will negatively impact the web pages usability and could lead to unhappy/ impatient users.</td>

<p> Overall, there are several benefits towards the optimisation of an image such as faster loading time, better user experience, and lower storage costs. The execution of these techniques are a crucial aspect of web performance and the user experience, benefitting both the website owners and visitors. In considering things such as compression of the size of an image file, choosing the correct format (JPG vs PNG), resizing the image etc, will all significantly impact the performance of my website and enhance its usability. </p>
<p>Additionally, the use of grey scale is not necessary, but is a good tool to check accessibility in images containing text and image, to ensure the colour contrasting is accessible.</p>
<p>In my future website, I would consider using greyscale as an option to turn on and off due to some user preference of tools such as dark mode.</p>
